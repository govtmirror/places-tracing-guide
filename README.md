# Places Tracing Guide

Currently in development.

### To-do:

#### Primary:

- [ ] Content updates/additions based on changes to data schema
- [ ] Remove links to OSM wikis
- [ ] Remove underlying tags tabs
- [ ] Change optional field presentation from tag to title as displayed in editor
- [ ] Fix anchors (add a hidden anchor before the header anchor and give it a negative top value to make up for the height of the navbar)

#### Secondary:

- [ ] Redo gifs to conform to changes to Editor interface (presets/classes)
- [ ] Implement service-wide individual `.json` files
- [ ] Fix [navbar button bug](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-tracing-guide/issues/13)
