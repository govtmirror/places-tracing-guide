# Places Tracing Guide

Currently in development.

### To-do:

#### Primary:

- [ ] Split `data/datasets.json` into separate `.json` files per feature
- [ ] Create separate searchable page listing *all* feature types available in Places to replace [data preset spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sQZRUZDe8vPu8PANxoIc5k0Pv85xNd5ae4uGJ0fwEt0/edit#gid=1063193272) - issue [here](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-tracing-guide/issues/14)

#### Secondary:

- [ ] Fix [navbar button bug](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-tracing-guide/issues/13)
- [ ] Redo road attribute (surface, oneway, lanes, maxspeed) gifs to use editor form
- [ ] Change optional field presentation from tag to title as displayed in editor
- [ ] Consider adding piste and water trail types individually (for better editor info link integration)
- [ ] Consider embedding POI icon into POI type buttons
- [ ] Separate datasets.json file out into individual JSONs that can be loaded programatically into Places Editor
