# Places Tracing Guide

Currently in development.

### To-do:

#### Primary:

- [ ] Implement service-wide individual `.json` files
- [ ] Highlight priority feature types for NPS.gov redesign: visitor centers, park districts, entrance stations, trails, campgrounds

#### Secondary:

- [ ] Fix [navbar button bug](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places-tracing-guide/issues/13)
- [ ] Redo road attribute (surface, oneway, lanes, maxspeed) gifs to use editor form
- [ ] Change optional field presentation from tag to title as displayed in editor
- [ ] Remove underlying tags (to be integrated into master feature list documentation)
- [ ] Consider embedding POI icon into POI type buttons
